# Video Action Recognition

In this exercise, I am going to implement S3D to classify the actions in UCF-11 video clips. The model is reduced for this assignment
and we are going to use only one stream for the RGB frames; for the original architecture, refer to the paper
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04851.pdf).
