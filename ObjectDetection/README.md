# Object detection

This jupyter notebook file implements some parts of the Faster R-CNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)
model, which is one of the most popular models for object detection using a neural network. It implements the Faster R-CNN for object detection on the VOC2007 dataset. It had developed the Fast R-CNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083) model by replacing selective search module, which
proposes regions target objects might be located in, to learnable RPN module. And this RPN module
is what we are going to concentrate on in this project.
